    Problem:
    Find the distinct number of ways to reach a certain 
    stair, if on any stair, we can climb take either
    one or two steps.

    Objective fn:
    f(i) is the distinct number of ways to get to the ith stair

    Recurrence Relation:
    f(i) = f(i - 1) + f(i - 2)

    Base case:
        f(0) = 1 => do nothing
        f(1) = 1
