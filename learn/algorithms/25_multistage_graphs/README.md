# Multistage graphs

A directed weighted graph that models decision-making processes involving  
multiple stages or phases, the outcome of each stage influencing the subsequent  
stages.

The goal is to minimize the cost or maximize the profits by making a certain  
sequence of decisions out of the possible sequences of decisions that can be  
made. 

Multistage graph problems are usually solved using dynamic programming.
