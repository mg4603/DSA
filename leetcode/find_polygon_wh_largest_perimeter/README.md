# Find Polygon With the Largest Perimeter

You are given an array of positive integers nums of length n.

A polygon is a closed plane figure that has at least 3 sides. The longest  
side of a polygon is smaller than the sum of its other sides.

Conversely, if you have k ($k \ge 3$) positive real numbers  
$a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_k$ where $a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3 \le ... \le a_k$ and  
$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_{k-1} > a_k$, then there always exists a polygon  
with $k$ sides whose lengths are $a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_k$.

The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of lengths of its sides.

Return the largest possible perimeter of a polygon whose sides can be formed  
from nums, or -1 if it is not possible to create a polygon.

 

## Example 1:

    Input: nums = [5,5,5]
    Output: 15
    Explanation: 
        The only possible polygon that can be made from 
            nums has 3 sides: 5, 5, and 5. The perimeter 
            is 5 + 5 + 5 = 15.

## Example 2:

    Input: nums = [1,12,1,2,5,50,3]
    Output: 12
    Explanation: 
        The polygon with the largest perimeter which can 
            be made from nums has 5 sides: 1, 1, 2, 3, 
            and 5. The perimeter is 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12.

        We cannot have a polygon with either 12 or 50 as 
            the longest side because it is not possible 
            to include 2 or more smaller sides that have 
            a greater sum than either of them.
            
        It can be shown that the largest possible perimeter 
            is 12.

## Example 3:

    Input: nums = [5,5,50]
    Output: -1
    Explanation: 
        There is no possible way to form a polygon from 
            nums, as a polygon has at least 3 sides and 
            50 > 5 + 5.

 

## Constraints:

* $3 \le n \le 10^5$
* $1 \le nums[i] \le 10^9$
