# Find Kth Largest XOR Coordinate Value

You are given a 2D matrix of size $m \times n$, consisting of non-negative integers.  
You are also given an integer k.

The value of coordinate $(a, b)$ of the matrix is the XOR of all  
$matrix[i][j]$ where $0 \le i \le a < m$ and $0 \le j \le b < n$ (0-indexed).

Find the $k^{th}$ largest value (1-indexed) of all the coordinates of matrix.

 

## Example 1:

    Input: matrix = [[5,2],[1,6]], k = 1
    Output: 7
    Explanation: 
        The value of coordinate (0,1) is 5 XOR 2 = 7, 
            which is the largest value.

## Example 2:

    Input: matrix = [[5,2],[1,6]], k = 2
    Output: 5
    Explanation: 
        The value of coordinate (0,0) is 5 = 5, 
            which is the 2nd largest value.

## Example 3:

    Input: matrix = [[5,2],[1,6]], k = 3
    Output: 4
    Explanation: 
        The value of coordinate (1,0) is 5 XOR 1 = 4, 
            which is the 3rd largest value.

 

## Constraints:

* $m == matrix.length$
* $n == matrix[i].length$
* $1 \le m, n \le 1000$
* $0 \le matrix[i][j] \le 10^6$
* $1 \le k \le m \times n$
